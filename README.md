## Purpose of this Research
Federated Lerning has been proposed as a machine learning method for edge computing.
Federated Lerning has been proposed as a machine learning method for edge computing. In federated learning
learning is performed at each node in the network without aggregating the learning data
and only the resulting parameter differences are communicated to each node in the network.
the learned model is constructed by communicating only the resulting parameter differences, and the privacy
The training data, including privacy data, is protected. Expectations for Machine Learning and the Global
and the global trend toward privacy protection, federative learning is expected to become an important part of the information society in the future.
In the future, federated learning is expected to occupy an important position in the information society due to the expectation of machine learning and the global trend toward privacy protection.
On the other hand, in the practical application of federated learning, the models that have been
on the other hand, the practical application of federated learning will require models that have been running in data centers to be deployed in edge environments with scarce computational resources.
In the practical application of federated learning, however, at least the following two issues need to be considered
The first is the reduction of learning parameters. The first is to reduce the weight of the model by reducing training parameters.
The second is to maximize the effective use of heterogeneous computational resources in the edge environment.
The first is to reduce the weight of the model by reducing the training parameters. For the former, pruning and neural architecture search can be used.
architecture search for the former, and agent-oriented architecture for the latter.
distributed processing systems based on agent-oriented architectures and large-scale
distributed processing systems using agent-oriented architectures and large-scale distributed computation
There have been a variety of precedents and studies to date. If we can construct a model that satisfies both of these requirements, it will be possible to
large scale neural network to the edge environment, and
and maximize the utilization of computational resources in the environment.
However, as far as the author knows, there is no research on a model that satisfies both of these requirements.
